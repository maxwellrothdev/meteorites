## Project Summary

This project is a self-continued study of a Harvard course problem set for Introduction to Databases with SQL. The original course assignment was an intermediate import, cleaning, and updating of a NASA data set of all known meteorite landings from The Meteoritical Society. The purpose of this self-continued study was to further analyze the data and develop more advanced skills in SQL and visualization tools.

A database (meteorites.db) was created and the data set imported as a CSV from NASAâ€™s Open Data Portal via command-line. The database schema was created (schema.sql), and the data was cleaned, updated, and queried for analysis and visualization (meteorites.sql).

The data set included coordinates but no other location data. To enrich the data for this project and future projects, a Python command-line program (reverse_geo.py) was written to perform reverse geocoding on a CSV file to extract location data, country data in this case, based on given coordinates. The program imports a CSV file as a Pandas DataFrame, takes a column of coordinates in set batches to not overwhelm the API, and returns a new column with the country data.

After designing a UI with Adobe and Figma, the database was connected via Google Cloud to Tableau to create visualizations and an interactive dashboard.
